## The 30-Minute Snap Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to manage state in a Snap and how to present a custom API for Dapps. The Snap you will implement is not meant to be an ideal way to manage an address book but rather to demonstrate some features to get you started building with Snaps. 

If you have not done so already, you should follow the [5-Minute Snap Tutorial](https://github.com/Montoya/gas-fee-snap#the-5-minute-snap-tutorial) before starting with this tutorial.
